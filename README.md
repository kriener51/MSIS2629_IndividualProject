# MSIS2629_IndividualProject
Individual project for MSIS 2629: Dashboards, Scorecards, and Visuals at Santa Clara University

Topic: Gun Violence <br />
Inspiration: https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/2/16399418/us-gun-violence-statistics-maps-charts

For this project, I present arguments in favor of and against stricter gun control in America. The assignment was to critique the Vox article and create our own visuals supporting each side of the argument.
